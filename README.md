# JetRadar

**JetRadar** is a Telegram bot and FastAPI service for monitoring activity of TON wallets. It consists of two main parts:

1. **FastAPI Service (`api/`)**  
   – Provides endpoints to fetch transaction history via TonAPI and generate wallet connection graphs.

2. **Telegram Bot (`bot/`)**  
   – Supports commands like `/start`, `/add`, `/list`, `/tx`.  
   – Uses the FastAPI backend for all data operations.

## Frontend

Install Node.js dependencies and run the React frontend located in `docs/react`:

```bash
cd docs/react
